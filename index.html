            <h1>The History of Computing</h1>

            <h3>Early Machines: Mechanical Calculators</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p>1600s: Inventors like Blaise Pascal and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz created early calculators that could do basic math. These were the first steps toward modern computers.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Concept of a Computer</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p>1837: Charles Babbage designed a machine called the Analytical Engine, which could do any kind of calculation. Although it was never built, it was the first idea of a true computer. Ada Lovelace, who worked with Babbage, is considered the first computer programmer.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The First Electronic Computers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p>1930s-1940s: Alan Turing introduced the idea of a machine that could solve any problem given the right instructions (later known as the Turing Machine).</p></li>
                <li><p>1941: Konrad Zuse built the Z3, the first working programmable computer.</p></li>
                <li><p>1945: The ENIAC was the first large-scale electronic computer, marking a big leap forward in computing.</p></li>

            </ul>

            <h3>Mainframes and the Birth of Software</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p>1950s-1960s: Large computers called mainframes were used by businesses and governments. IBM was a major player, creating the IBM System/360.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Microprocessor and Personal Computers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p>1971: Intel created the microprocessor, a tiny chip that could run a computer. This made it possible to create smaller, cheaper computers.</p></li>
                <li><p>1970s-1980s: The first personal computers, like the Apple I and IBM PC, were introduced, bringing computing into homes and small businesses.</p></li>

                </div>
                <li><p>1984: Apple introduced the Macintosh, the first widely available computer with a graphical interface</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Internet and the Digital Age</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p>1969: The ARPANET, the first version of the Internet, was created, allowing computers to communicate with each other.</p></li>
                <li><p>1990s: The World Wide Web made the Internet easy to use and accessible to everyone. This changed how people communicate, work, and play.</p></ul>
            </ul>
       
            <h3>Mobile and Cloud Computing</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><p>2007: The iPhone brought powerful computing to our pockets, starting the smartphone revolution.</p></li>
            <li><p>2010s: Cloud computing made it possible to store and access data over the Internet, changing how businesses and individuals use computers.</p></li>
            </ul>

            <h4><strong><i>Computing has changed the world by creating jobs, improving business, and making communication easier. It helps with online learning, better healthcare, and staying connected with others. Overall, it has made a big impact on our lives and will keep shaping the future.</i></strong></h4>

            <h1>Introduction to IT Basics</h1>

            <h3><b>Hardware</b></h3>
            <p><b>Hardware</b> is the physical parts of a computer like the CPU (the brain of the computer), memory (which helps things run faster), and storage (where data is saved). It also includes things like keyboards, mice, and screens.</p>

            <h3><b>Software</b></h3>
            <p><b>Software</b> is the program that run on hardware</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>System Software</strong> is the operating system (like windows or macOS) that controls everything on the computer</li>
                <li><strong>Application software</strong> includes apps like word processors and web browsers that let you do specific tasks.</li>
            </ul>

            </div>

            <h3><b>Networking</b></h3>
            <p><b>Networking</b> is how computers and devices connect to each other to share information. This can be done through wired connections (like Ethernet cables) or wireless connections (like Wi-Fi). Networks can be small, like in a home, or large, like the Internet, which connects millions of devices worldwide.</p>

            <h3>Role of IT in Modern Organizations</h3>
            <p>IT plays a crucial role in modern organizations by helping them manage data, communicate efficiently, and automate processes. Companies use IT for tasks like storing customer information, managing finances, and running websites. IT also enables remote work and global collaboration, making businesses more flexible and competitive.</p>
